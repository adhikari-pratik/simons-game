# Simon Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, a memory skill game where players must remember and replicate increasingly long sequences of colors and sounds. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it offers an engaging way to test and improve your memory. This was  developed as a part of learning the basics of html, css and javascript and how to integrate it together.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Press the start button to begin the game.
2. **Watch the Sequence:** The game will flash a sequence of colors and play corresponding sounds.
3. **Repeat the Sequence:** Click on the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence. The sequence will grow by one color each round.
4. **Continue Playing:** Try to remember and repeat the sequence for as long as possible. The game ends if you make a mistake.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS:** Styling of the game elements.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic, sequence generation, and user interaction handling.
